                        One of my first ever CAD models created was done in a
                        software called Alias Autodesk. After learning the basics of
                        surface modelling we were introduced to the one of the final
                        assignments which was to modell a remote control that you
                        designed.

                    <p class="p-font">
                        The end result came to be a remote control that was meant to be used for smart-TV. A goal of mine was to scale down the amount of buttons that is on a regular remote and try to focus on navigation with arrows and a home-button.
